      'An aesthetics specialist told us: "I lose 3 hours a day between WhatsApp, my Google Calendar, and the spreadsheet where I track leads." He wasn\'t the only one. We saw dental clinics managing patients in Excel, losing leads because nobody followed the pipeline, and confirming appointments one by one by phone.',
      'We understood that clinics didn\'t need "yet another software." They needed an intelligent platform that spoke their language: with pipelines for aesthetics, dental, and dermatology. With appointments synced to Google Calendar. With AI that analyzes calls and detects opportunities.',
      'That\'s how Grialink was born: an omnichannel CRM with integrated AI modules, built from the ground up for the healthcare sector by a team that understands both technology and the operational reality of a clinic.',
